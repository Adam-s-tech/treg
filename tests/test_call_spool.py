"""Spooled settlement evidence: a large metered 2xx is read to disk, never into RAM.

`_spool_response` keeps `_buffer_response`'s contract (complete evidence before headers, never a
prefix, an oversized body fails uncharged) for endpoints that declare `spooled_response`. These
tests pin the byte-exact replay, the evidence projection, and that every path returns the file
and its budget: success, oversize, a busy process, an upstream failure, cancellation and a
response that is dropped without being closed.
