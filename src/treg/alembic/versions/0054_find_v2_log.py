"""searchlog + searchmiss: what the job-first find (find_engine v2) records

Revision ID: 0054
Revises: 0053
Create Date: 2026-09-30

`searchlog` gains the engine that answered a web find (v1 | v2; shadow mode writes one row for
each) and v2's own readings: the judge's platform choice and its confidence, the name probability,
recall and embedding times, the embedding error, and every unit the judge read as [kind, id, p].
`searchmiss` gains why a find came back empty (gap | not_task | judge_off). All nullable, no
defaults: metadata-only on Postgres, and rows written before read as unknown.
